        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Ryan Han and I am currently a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am studying Psychology and Education (with a concentration in learning and behavioral studies). I am striving for a career in an educational setting, driven by my passion for working with young children and youth. After graduating, I intend to go to graduate school for either developmental psychology or education. Afterwards, I hope to lead a life mentoring students as they live life and grow.<br><br>

        Since high school, I have spent a significant amount of time working with and shaping young students. I spent my summers volunteering as a Camp Counselor, mentoring other younger counselors and leading elementary and middle school campers throughout the camp day. All while maintaining an enthusiastic and upbeat attitude, I enjoyed leading activities and getting to know each camper. After school during the school year, I would also babysit for family friends, spending time with elementary age children by playing games with them and preparing snacks. Additionally, I worked as a tutor for world history. I did extensive research prior to tutoring middle schoolers via Zoom and spent considerable time crafting engaging slideshows on Google Slides and preparing memory activities for them. These experiences taught me to be able to lead, work on my own, work with others, and find creative solutions to difficult conflicts. Spending considerable time with young students also made me appreciate how intelligent they can be even at a young age, inspiring me to help nurture them.<br><br>

        Throughout high school, I was a teachers' assistant at my local Korean school every Saturday. I ran various errands for teachers, including printing copies of worksheets or homework, cleaning classrooms before and after the school day, and managing difficult students so the teacher had space to teach. I would also substitute for teachers who could not come in. I was also in charge of miscellaneous tasks outside of the classroom - Running before and aftercare, playing slideshow presentations in the back, managing sound systems, preparing lunch foods, and decorating the halls. In my senior year of high school, I was entrusted with my own classroom. For a semester, I taught Korean language, culture, and history to a class of 12 second graders. I learned how to come up with creative games, how to manage a classroom, and how to build a mutual rapport with my students. From these experiences, I have grown significantly as a person and teacher.
